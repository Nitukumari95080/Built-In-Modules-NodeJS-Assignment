Node.js Architecture:
----------------------
1. **Single-Threaded Event Loop**: Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop that allows it to handle multiple operations concurrently by managing events and executing callbacks.

2. **Non-Blocking I/O**: Node.js uses non-blocking, asynchronous I/O operations, which means that operations like reading from a file or querying a database do not block the execution of other code.

3. **V8 JavaScript Engine**: Node.js uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine to execute JavaScript code. V8 compiles JavaScript into machine code for fast execution.

4. **Libuv Library**: Node.js relies on the Libuv library for handling asynchronous operations and providing a consistent API for file system and network operations across different platforms.

5. **Callback Functions**: Node.js relies heavily on callback functions to handle the results of asynchronous operations. This allows the event loop to remain responsive and handle multiple operations simultaneously.

6. **Modules**: Node.js uses a modular system where functionality is divided into modules. Each module is a separate file that can be imported and used in other modules, promoting code reusability and organization.
Advantages of Node.js:
- Non-blocking I/O
- Single-threaded model
- Scalability
- Large ecosystem of packages
